# SCN

SCN is a structural covariance network pipeline built in python. Currently a work in progress it uses the scona package as a basis for building the graphs then use the methodology out line by Drakesmith to permutate for group differences. 

At the current time SCN can't calculate or permuate group differences for nodal measures only global measure. Hopefully in future releases this functionality can be added.
